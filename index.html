          <h2>About the Leyat Helica</h2>
          <p class="text">The Leyat Helica was a revolutionary French automobile manufactured between 1919 and 1925 by
            Marcel Leyat.
            Unlike traditional cars, it was propelled by a giant front-mounted propeller powered by an 8 bhp Scorpion
            engine. With its lightweight plywood body, the Helica weighed just 250 kg (550 lb), making it capable of
            reaching impressive speeds for its time. Passengers sat behind each other as in an aircraft, emphasizing its
            aerodynamic design.</p>

      <h2>History of the Helica</h2>
      <p>Marcel Leyat, an engineer and aviation pioneer born in 1885, envisioned a vehicle that combined aeronautical
        principles with automotive design. After graduating from the École Centrale Paris in 1907, he worked on various
        aircraft projects before introducing the Helica in 1919. Over six years, Leyat produced approximately 30
        vehicles, continually experimenting with different configurations. In 1927, a Helica set a speed record of 106
        mph (171 km/h) at the Montlhéry circuit, showcasing its remarkable performance.</p>

          Dangerous Curves Ahead
          And so, the story began...
          Three years ago
          In a faraway land
          A huge storm was brewing
          And the sky was turning black
          The wind was howling
          And the lightning cracked
          The rain was pouring
          And the thunder roared
          The people were running
          And the animals were scared
          The storm was raging
          And the clouds were dark
          The trees were swaying
          And the dogs did bark
          The lightning struck
          And the thunder roared
          The rain was pouring
          And the wind did soar
